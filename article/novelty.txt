In this article, a new approach to implementing the coupling function in normalizing flows is proposed, using the integration of continuous piecewise-affine (CPA) velocity functions. This method significantly enhances the flexibility of normalizing flows, allowing them to approximate any differentiable monotonic function while still having a closed-form, tractable Jacobian determinant that can be inverted analytically. This new parameterization is fully differentiable, allowing for training by gradient methods. The resulting class of normalizing flows is referred to as closed-form diffeomorphic spline flows (DIFW-NF), which can feature either coupling layers or autoregressive layers. The experiments show that this new approach obtains competitive results in a variety of high-dimensional datasets.
